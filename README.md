# :trophy: The Horiseon Refactor Challenge :trophy:

## Overview :book:
For this challenge I was assigned to refactor an existing webpage in order to build on accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) by structuring HTML semantic elements and consolidating CSS selectors.

### User Story :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Client's Acceptance Criteria :pencil2:
```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
